My work is inspired by the Mobileye's [C2-270](http://www.mobileye.com/products/mobileye-c2-series/mobileye-c2-270/), which is a mono-camera based automobile vision system.

I am just a beginer, so I haven't done much work yet.

Here:

 * **OpenCarVison** build an UI to perform automobile-vision-releated experiment based on QT & OpenCV.
 * **LaneSystem** is forked from [DriverAssist](https://github.com/Marcello-LI/DriverAssist).
